Backend Development:

Backend Features:
Order Data Handling:

Collect Order Details: When the user fills out the checkout form, capture:

Product Details (name, quantity, price).

Customer Details (name, address, phone, WhatsApp, email).

Store in Session or Temporary Database: Since you don’t need a full-fledged database at this point, store the order data in session storage or a temporary database to generate the WhatsApp message.

WhatsApp API Integration:

Once the customer confirms the order, trigger the WhatsApp API link to send the order details to the admin’s WhatsApp and confirm with the customer.

The WhatsApp link format is already defined:

Admin can then confirm the order directly on WhatsApp.

Order Tracking (Future Enhancement):

For scalability, future development could involve tracking orders in a simple database. You could allow customers to log in and view past orders.

UI/UX Design with Premium Feel:
Smooth, Minimalist Design:

Use dark backgrounds (black or charcoal gray) with gold and silver accents to convey luxury.

Whitespace should be abundant around products and forms, giving the page an airy, uncluttered feel.

Interactive Animations:

Hover effects: When the user hovers over a product, subtle effects should highlight the product, showing details like price, discount, and "Buy Now" button.

Buttons: All CTAs (e.g., “Add to Cart,” “Buy Now”) should have smooth transitions and golden accents.

Elegant Typography:

Use serif fonts for product names and headings, and sans-serif for content, ensuring readability.

Clear and large font sizes for headings and product descriptions.

Mobile-Friendly:

Ensure all pages are fully responsive, keeping the premium design intact on both desktop and mobile devices.

Product images should adjust to screen sizes without losing their high-quality detail.
